# qBuildr
Builds a playlist on your Spotify account by presenting shuffled sets of songs that can be easily skipped or added. Includes other functionalities such as the ability to easy add specific songs by typing in the name.

Great if you've ever found yourself wanting to listen to a specific playlist but do not want to waste time searching through the entire playlist, adding songs to a queue one at a time.
The songs are displayed, with their cover art, on a window. There are four buttons on the window:
Yellow: Close the window
Blue: Adds the song to the front of the playlist
Green: Adds the song to the end of the playist
Red: Skip the song
The blue, green, and red buttons are modeled off of the Tinder UI (swiping up, right, and left respectively)

Required modules:
sys, random, pprint, spotipy, urllib, tkinter, and PIL
